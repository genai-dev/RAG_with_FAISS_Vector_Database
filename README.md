Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline with FAISS Vector Database
Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) database for efficient similarity search. The RAG pipeline enhances natural language processing tasks by leveraging retrieved context to generate rich, informed responses.

Features
Efficient Information Retrieval: Integrates FAISS for fast and scalable retrieval of relevant documents.
Enhanced NLP Responses: Combines the power of pre-trained language models with the contextual relevance of retrieval databases.
Customizable Pipeline: Easily adaptable to various NLP tasks such as question answering, document summarization, or conversational agents.
